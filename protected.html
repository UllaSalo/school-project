        <h2>Protecting Wolves in Europe</h2>
        <p>The hounded hunters
Mankind's relationship to the wolf is ambivalent â€“ on the one hand the animal is admired as a skilled and untiring hunter but also ill-famed as Isengrim the bloodthirsty and persecuted. In many parts of Europe these once common grey-coated raiders have long disappeared. EuroNatur is collaborating with internationally recognized wolf experts and selected partners in promoting ways to make it possible for wolves to re-establish themselves in Europe again.
What are the threats to wolves in Europe?
Wolves are highly adaptable and could in fact flourish in a variety of habitats. However in the course of centuries they have been driven back into more and more remote wooded areas. In many countries they have been mercilessly hunted and finally wiped out. Although today the wolf is granted highest protection status in many EU countries there are still repeated incidents of wolves being shot. In addition the increasing fragmentation of the countryside through the construction of roads, housing developments and the intensification of farming methods all pose problems for their survival.</p>
